MHI-Based Fall Detection using Machine Learning

## Key Features
Motion History Images (MHI): Uses MHI to create a single, information-rich image that represents the temporal flow and direction of motion.

Contrast Enhancement: Applies histogram equalization on input frames to ensure robust motion detection even in varied lighting conditions.

Efficient Feature Extraction: The MHI is simply vectorized, creating a powerful yet compact feature set for classification.

Machine Learning Integration: Employs a suite of powerful classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, Decision Tree, k-NN) for accurate and reliable fall detection.

Real-Time Capable: The entire pipeline is optimized for efficiency, allowing for deployment in real-time monitoring systems.

## Methodology Pipeline
The fall detection process follows these sequential steps:

Video Input & Preprocessing 

The system processes video frames in sequence.

Each RGB frame is converted to grayscale, and histogram equalization is applied to enhance contrast.

MHI Generation 

A Motion History Image (MHI) is generated by accumulating motion differences between consecutive frames.

In the MHI, pixel intensity corresponds to motion recencyâ€”brighter pixels indicate more recent movement, while darker pixels represent older motion. This effectively encodes the entire motion sequence into a single image.

Feature Vectorization 

The final MHI, which summarizes the entire motion, is flattened into a one-dimensional feature vector.

ML Classification 

This feature vector is fed into a pre-trained machine learning model.

The model classifies the motion as either a Fall or a Non-Fall activity.
